# Folders Graph

Add folders as nodes to graph views. Use [virtual-dirs](https://github.com/d7sd6u/obsidian-virtual-dirs) to be able to open these nodes as (virtual) notes and hop between notes and folders seamlessly. Folders look like attachments in the graph view and connections are directed from parents to children. Folder notes are colored differently to regular notes.

## Other plugins

- [lazy-cached-vault-load](https://github.com/d7sd6u/obsidian-lazy-cached-vault-load) - Reduces startup time on mobile to 2-3 seconds, even with a vault containing 30k+ notes.
- [reveal-folded](https://github.com/d7sd6u/obsidian-reveal-folded) - Adds a command that reveals the current file in the file explorer while collapsing all other items.
- [auto-folder-note-paste](https://github.com/d7sd6u/obsidian-auto-folder-note-paste) - Ensures your attachments are placed inside your note when pasting or using drag-and-drop by converting your note into a folder note.
- [folders-graph](https://github.com/d7sd6u/obsidian-folders-graph) - Adds folders as nodes in graph views.
- [hide-index-files](https://github.com/d7sd6u/obsidian-hide-index-files) - Hides folder notes (index files) from the file explorer.
- [crosslink-advanced](https://github.com/d7sd6u/obsidian-crosslink-advanced) - Adds commands for managing [ftags](https://github.com/d7sd6u/obsidian-lazy-cached-vault-load?tab=readme-ov-file#wait-a-minute-what-are-folderindex-notes-what-are-ftags-what-do-you-mean-annexed)-oriented vaults: adding ftags, creating child notes, opening random unftagged file, etc.
- [virtual-dirs](https://github.com/d7sd6u/obsidian-virtual-dirs) - Adds 'virtual' folder files or folder indexes. You can open and search for them, but they do not take up space and 'materialize' whenever you need a real folder note.
- [viewer-ftags](https://github.com/d7sd6u/obsidian-viewer-ftags) - add ftags as chips on top of markdown/file editors/previews. And children as differently styled chips too!
- [git-annex-autofetch](https://github.com/d7sd6u/obsidian-git-annex-autofetch) - Allows you to open annexed files that are not locally present as if they were on your device (essentially, an NFS/overlay-fs hybrid in Obsidian).
