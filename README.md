# Folders Graph

Adds folders as nodes to graph views. Use [virtual-dirs](https://github.com/d7sd6u/obsidian-virtual-dirs) to be able to open these nodes as (virtual) notes and hop between notes and folders seamlessly. Folders look like attachments in the graph view and connections are directed from parents to children. Folder notes are colored differently to regular notes.

## Other plugins

- [lazy-cached-vault-load](https://github.com/d7sd6u/obsidian-lazy-cached-vault-load) - reduce startup time on mobile to 2-3s even with 30k+ notes vault
- [auto-folder-note-paste](https://github.com/d7sd6u/obsidian-auto-folder-note-paste) - makes sure your attachments are "inside" your note on paste and drag'n'drop by making your note a folder note
- [reveal-folded](https://github.com/d7sd6u/obsidian-reveal-folded) - reveal current file in file explorer while collapsing everything else
- [hide-index-files](https://github.com/d7sd6u/obsidian-hide-index-files) - hide folder notes (index files) from file explorer
- [crosslink-advanced](https://github.com/d7sd6u/obsidian-crosslink-advanced) - adds commands to deal with ftags-oriented vaults: add ftags, create child note, open random unftagged file, etc.
- [virtual-dirs](https://github.com/d7sd6u/obsidian-virtual-dirs) - adds "virtual" folder files / folder indexes. You can open them, you can search for them, but they do not take space and "materialise" whenever you want a _real_ folder note
- [viewer-ftags](https://github.com/d7sd6u/obsidian-viewer-ftags) - add ftags as chips on top of markdown/file editors/previews. And children as differently styled chips too!
- [git-annex-autofetch](https://github.com/d7sd6u/obsidian-git-annex-autofetch) - lets you open annexed but not present files as if they were right on your device (basically, NFS/overlay-fs hybrid in your Obsidian)

## Contributing

Issues and patches are welcome. This plugin is intended to be used with other plugins and I would try to do my best to support this use case, but I retain the right to refuse supporting any given plugin for arbitrary reasons.
